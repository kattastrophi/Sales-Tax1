# Sales-Tax1
This was a project I was doing while working at T-Mobile. It was written after following some of the MOOC course for Java.

The premise is that you are able to calculate full sales tax for many different items at T-Mobile. It asks for the phone/device's full price, then checks to see if 
you have an accessories. It also calculates the "support charge" (which is a charge T-Mobile attaches to any device sales, kind of like an activation fee)
into the final price as well. It is a very primitive calculator and I had bigger plans with it like adding a GUI and whatnot. However, I am no longer working at
T-Mobile and as such, have stop working on the project. I am keeping this here as a way to look back and see how far I have come as I complete my degree in CS.
